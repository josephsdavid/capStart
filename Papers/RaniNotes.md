# Recent Techniques of Clustering Time Series Data: A Survey: Notes

## Abstract: 

* Three types of ts clustering
	* raw data
	* feature based
	* model based
* We will summarize the state of the field as of 2012

## Introduction

> what is time series clustering?

Unsupervised classification of a set of unlabeled time series into groups or clusters, where each group is more or less homogeneous.
 
 Two types of clustering:
 * Shape level:
 	* Based on multiple time series
* Structural level:
	* Based on a single, very long time series 


## Major issues with time series clustering:

* High dimensionality
* Temporal order issues
* Noise

## Three types again:

1. Temporal-Proximity-Based Clustering:
	* Works directly on raw data, either in frequency or time domain
2. Representation-Based Clustering:
	* Works indirectly with features extracted from the raw data
3. Model-Based Clustering:
	* Works on the models built from the raw data (pretty wild)


## Making an effective model;

There are two techniques for making an effective time series clustering model:
