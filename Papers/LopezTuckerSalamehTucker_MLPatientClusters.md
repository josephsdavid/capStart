# An unsupervised machine learning method for discovering patient clustersbased on genetic signatures

**Source: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.004**

## Highlights

* Patient clusters based on their genomic makeup.

* Discovery of significant variants between patient sub-groups.

* Relationship between the genomic clusters and clinically relevant outcomes.

* Assign high-risk and chronic disease patients into a discovered cluster.

## Conclusion

Once links are drawn between clusters and clinically relevant outcomes,
Immunochip data can be used to classify high-risk and newly diagnosed chronic
disease patients into known clusters for predictive value. Further investigation
can extend beyond pathway analysis to evaluate these clusters for clinical
significance of genetically related characteristics such as age of onset,
disease course, heritability, and response to treatment.
